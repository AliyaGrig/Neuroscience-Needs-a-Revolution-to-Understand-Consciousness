# Neuroscience-Needs-a-Revolution-to-Understand-Consciousness

I'm taking a moment to share my gratitude and reflections on the "#Neuroscience Needs a Revolution to Understand Consciousness" event that took place this past Sunday.

First off, a heartfelt thank you to all who joined in and made the event truly special. Your presence and engagement mean the world to me!

It was an absolute honor to be part of the "Varieties of Conscious Experience" segment, where I had the privilege of delving into a topic very close to my heart: "EMPATHY AS A BUILDING BLOCK TO ARTIFICIAL CONSCIOUSNESS."

Exploring the intricate connection between human emotions and the evolving landscape of #artificialintelligence was truly a captivating journey.

Sharing the panel with the renowned Deepak Chopra was an unforgettable experience. His wisdom and insights added a whole new dimension to the conversation, and I feel truly fortunate to have been part of such a dynamic exchange of ideas.

While the event may have passed, the impact of our discussions continues to resonate. The exploration of #consciousness, empathy in the realm of technology, and the potential for artificial consciousness remain ever-relevant and thought-provoking topics.

Let's continue to explore the uncharted territories of knowledge and possibility, shaping the future together. Stay tuned for more exciting conversations and discoveries on the horizon!
